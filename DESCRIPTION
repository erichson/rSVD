Description: Randomized singular value decomposition (rsvd) is a very fast
    probabilistic algorithm to compute the near optimal low-rank singular value
    decomposition of massive data sets with high accuracy. SVD plays a central role
    in data analysis and scientific computing. SVD is also widely used for computing
    (randomized) principal component analysis (PCA), a linear dimensionality reduction technique.
    Randomized PCA (rpca) is using the approximated singular value decomposition
    to compute the most significant principal components. The package includes also an
    function for computing (randomized) robust principal component analysis (RPCA).
    In addition several plot functions are provided.
