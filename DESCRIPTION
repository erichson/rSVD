Description: Randomized singular value decomposition (rsvd) is a very fast probabilistic
	algorithm to compute an approximated low-rank singular value decomposition of large
	data sets with high accuracy. SVD plays a central role in data analysis and scientific computing.
	SVD is also widely used for computing principal component analysis (PCA), a linear
    	dimensionality reduction technique.  Randomized PCA (rpca) is using the approximated singular value
    	decomposition to compute the most significant principal components. In addition several plot functions
    	are provided.
